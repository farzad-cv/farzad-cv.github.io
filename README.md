My favourite aspect of my job is to do the Risk Assessemnt for future projects, then strategizing to de-escalate the identified risks, e.g. if there is a lack of language or technology with in the team then I will try to learn it, I go above and beyond to make sure I can trasfer the best practice to the engineering team. finally I run workshop and make sure everyone is up to speed.
