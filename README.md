## 💬 About Me

I'm Farzad Jalali, a Software Engineer, Architect, Leader, Problem solver. It's my goal to utilize my skills to build secure, reliable and scalable cloud native application, helping business to thrive. I'm always looking to improve and continue learning!

My strongest strength (after being a problem solver) is being able to quickly learn new
technologies and switch between them. In fact, That’s what I love to do!

My favourite aspect of my job is to do the Risk Assessemnt for future projects, then strategizing to de-escalate the identified risks, e.g. if there is a lack of language or technology with in the team then I will try to learn it, I go above and beyond to make sure I can trasfer the best practice to the engineering team. finally I run workshop and make sure everyone is up to speed.
